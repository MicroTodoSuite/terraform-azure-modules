# Infrastructure-as-Code Exceptions

Findings of the rule contracts, tflint, Trivy, or SonarCloud that the team has
decided to accept. A row waives a contract finding only when it carries a
reason and an expiry; the format is defined in
`microservice-app-ai-agents/rules/iac/README.md`. Rows for tflint, Trivy, and
SonarCloud record the decision behind a suppression made in that tool or in
the code (`NOSONAR`, `.trivyignore`), which must cite the row. Each row is added
in its own reviewed pull request.
