# terraform-azure-modules

Reusable Terraform modules for Azure. The MicroTodoSuite live repositories
consume them by tag. GaCode Solutions maintains them for the MicroTodoSuite
platform it operates for Lexfield Legal.

The modules serve the Azure disaster-recovery domain (gitops
`specs/009-full-platform-rollout` user story 5), which the program sequences
after the AWS rebuild.

Each top-level directory is one module with a single responsibility, and each
module is versioned on its own (MTS-IAC-102). A change to one module never
forces a consumer of another to move.

## Consuming a module

Always use the full Git URL and an exact module tag:

```hcl
module "identity" {
  source = "git::https://github.com/MicroTodoSuite/terraform-azure-modules.git//<module>?ref=<module>-v1.0.0"

  providers = {
    azurerm.project = azurerm.principal
  }

  # Names arrive built by the root (PC-IAC-025); governance codes feed tags.
  client      = var.client
  project     = var.project
  environment = var.environment
}
```

Modules configure no provider. They receive `azurerm.project` from the
consuming root (PC-IAC-005). The root's provider block carries the
`features {}` block, the subscription, and `resource_provider_registrations`,
which azurerm 5.0 defaults to `none`. The Azure provider has no default tags,
so each module applies the governance tags itself.

## Versions and releases

- Tags have the form `<module>-v<MAJOR>.<MINOR>.<PATCH>`, for example
  `aks-cluster-v1.2.0`.
- Commits that touch a module use the module's name as the Conventional Commit
  scope, for example `feat(aks-cluster): ...`. A `BREAKING CHANGE` footer
  produces a major version. A commit touches one module only.
- release-please, in manifest mode, opens a release pull request per module
  from merged commits and keeps each module's `CHANGELOG.md`. A new module is
  registered in `release-please-config.json` in its own pull request.

## Adding a module

Copy `_template/`, rename it, and fill every file. The template follows
PC-IAC-001: `versions.tf`, `providers.tf`, `variables.tf`, `locals.tf`,
`data.tf`, `main.tf`, `outputs.tf`, `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, a runnable
`sample/`, and `tests/` with `terraform test` files against a mocked provider.

## Checks

Every pull request runs the organization's reusable `iac-checks` gate:
- the rule contracts;
- `terraform fmt`;
- `terraform test` for each module;
- `terraform validate` for each sample;
- tflint;
- Trivy, failing on HIGH and CRITICAL findings.

A finding is waived only by a row, with a reason and an expiry, in
`docs/iac-exceptions.md`. The rules are in `microservice-app-ai-agents/rules/iac/`.
